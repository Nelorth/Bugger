report = # Report

home = # Homepage

login = # Login

password_forgot = # Forgot Password\n\
  If you have forgotten your password, you can reset your password on this page. To do this, you only need to enter \
  your e-mail address and username registered in the system and we will send you a link shortly after sending it, \
  through which you can set a new password.\n\n\
  In case you got here by accident, you can always use the "Login" button to get back to the login page.

password_set = # Set Password\n\
  On this page you can assign a new password. To do this, you must first type the desired new password in both text \
  fields and press the "Set Password" button.\n\n\
  If both passwords match and you have followed the specified criteria when choosing your password, you will be \
  automatically logged in and redirected to the start page.

register = # Register

statistics = # Statistics

topic = # Topic

admin = ## Administration\n\
  You have several options to configure the system. You can decide whether anonymous users have read access to the \
  system. If you decide to grant read-access only to logged-in users, anonymous users will be redirected to the login \
  page when accessing out of bounds pages. By default, anonymous users have read access. You can allow users to create \
  posts in closed reports. By default, this option is switched off. You can define email formats such as \
  `<user>@fim.uni-passau.de`. Users registering after this change will have to provide an e-mail address matching one \
  of the defined formats.\n\n\
  You can create new users by clicking on the `Create` button at the top of the page. Users created that way do not \
  have to verify their e-mail and will be able to log in immediately.\n\n\
  You can edit a whitelist of datatypes (e.g. `.png`) users are allowed to upload when creating posts. Limiting the \
  data types enhances security. You can define the boundaries between a user's voting weight by specifying the number \
  of posts a user needs to create to reach the next level.\n\n\
  You can upload the logo of your company and specify its name. They will be displayed prominently in the header. You \
  can specify the imprint and privacy policy of your company in the corresponding input fields, in which \
  [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)  is supported. Links to the respective pages are rendered in the footer. \
  You can choose from a variety of pre-defined color schemes to change the look and feel of your page. You can also \
  upload your own CSS files into the `design/themes` folder. Please note that you are required to save your own CSS \
  files and translation modules separately, since they are not persisted in the database.

post_edit = ## Edit Post\n\
  This page allows you to create or edit a post. You can use [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/) to style the \
  text you enter in the content area. By typing *`!Topic-ID`*, *`#Report-ID`* or *`#Post-ID`* you can reference a \
  specific topic, report or post with the corresponding ID. The reference will be displayed as a link to the \
  corresponding topic, report or post. Similarly, you can reference a user by typing *`@username`*.\n\n\
  **Moderators** of a topic can delete or edit any post in the topic. When deleting the first post linked to the \
  creation of the report, the report itself is deleted alongside it.
