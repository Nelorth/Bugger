  - *Logo*: Clicking the logo will take you to the homepage from any other page.\n\
  - *Search*: In the search bar one can enter search terms and thus search for reports, users and areas. This is a \

  if JavaScript is enabled.\n\
  - *Login*: If you already have an account in our system, you can use this button to log in to the system and thus \
  use the functions that have then been unlocked for you.\n\

report = # Report

report_create = # Create Report

home = # Homepage

login = # Login

password_forgot = # Forgot Password\n\
  If you have forgotten your password, you can reset your password on this page. To do this, you only need to enter \
  your e-mail address and username registered in the system and we will send you a link shortly after sending it, \
  through which you can set a new password.\n\n\
  In case you got here by accident, you can always use the "Login" button to get back to the login page.

password_set = # Set Password\n\
  On this page you can assign a new password. To do this, you must first type the desired new password in both text \
  fields and press the "Set Password" button.\n\n\
  If both passwords match and you have followed the specified criteria when choosing your password, you will be \
  automatically logged in and redirected to the start page.

profile = # Profile

register = # Register

search = ## Search\n\
  You can type something in the search bar here (not the one in the header) and hit enter or click on the search \
  button to search the site.\n\n\
  You can change which kind of result you want to view by using the buttons below the search bar labeled with the \
  various result types. \
  Beneath those buttons are various filters you can set (save for topic results). When searching for reports, you can \
  specify a latest opening date and an earliest closing date with the format displayed in the input fields. Only \
  reports that were opened before the opening date and not closed before the closing date are displayed. \
  Ticking or unticking the checkboxes below will allow you to further narrow down your search. \
  Finally, you can restrict your search to one particular topic by choosing one from the dropdown menu. Picking none \
  will perform a search across all topics.\n\
  When searching for users, you can filter out both admins and non-admins.\n\n\
  Located below the filter options is a paginated list containing the results. Clicking on one of them will take you \
  to the page containing that result. \
  Clicking on the various column labels of the result list will sort the list. Clicking on the same label again will \
  reverse the order. \
  The controls at the top and bottom of the list will allow you to change between pages and set how many results \
  are displayed per page.

statistics = ## Statistics\n\
  Hey, you found the statistics! A bunch of interesting facts about the system are summarized here. \
  What catches the eye at first are three big key figures:\n\
  - **Open Report Count:** The total count of open reports in the selected scope\n\
  - **Average Time Open:** The average time until a report in the selected scope is closed\n\
  - **Average #Posts/Report:** The average number of posts per report in the selected scope\n\n\
  These can be limited to only a certain topic via the drop-down to the right. If no topic is selected as \
  scope, all figures are evaluated system-wide. The figures can also be constrained onto a certain time interval to be \
  considered by providing a latest allowed creation date and an earliest allowed closing date for reports to be \
  taken into account.\n\n\
  The two leaderboards below the figures provide for some competition:\n\
  - **Hottest Reports:** Ranks the top 10 reports _system-wide_ (along with their creators) with regard to the \
  amount of relevance gained within the last 24 hours. Click on the title of a report or its creator’s username to \
  directly get to the corresponding page.\n\
  - **Most Relevant Users:** Ranks the top 10 most relevant users _system-wide_ with regard to the amount of relevance \
  their created reports collectively received. Click on a username to get to that user's profile page.\n\n\
  Have you found your username among the leaderboards yet?

topic = # Topic

admin = ## Administration\n\
  You have several options to configure the system. You can decide whether anonymous users have read access to the \
  system. If you decide to grant read-access only to logged-in users, anonymous users will be redirected to the login \
  page when accessing out of bounds pages. By default, anonymous users have read access. You can allow users to create \
  posts in closed reports. By default, this option is switched off. You can define email formats such as \
  `<user>@fim.uni-passau.de`. Users registering after this change will have to provide an e-mail address matching one \
  of the defined formats.\n\n\
  You can create new users by clicking on the `Create` button at the top of the page. Users created that way do not \
  have to verify their e-mail and will be able to log in immediately.\n\n\
  You can edit a whitelist of data types (e.g. `.png`) users are allowed to upload when creating posts. Limiting the \
  data types enhances security. You can define the boundaries between a user's voting weight by specifying the number \
  of posts a user needs to create to reach the next level.\n\n\
  You can upload the logo of your company and specify its name. They will be displayed prominently in the header. You \
  can specify the imprint and privacy policy of your company in the corresponding input fields, in which \
  [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)  is supported. Links to the respective pages are rendered in the footer. \
  You can choose from a variety of pre-defined color schemes to change the look and feel of your page. You can also \
  upload your own CSS files into the `design/themes` folder. Please note that you are required to save your own CSS \
  files and translation modules separately, since they are not persisted in the database.

post_edit = ## Edit Post\n\
  This page allows you to create or edit a post. You can use [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/) to style the \
  text you enter in the content area. By typing *`!Topic-ID`*, *`#Report-ID`* or *`##Post-ID`* you can reference a \
  specific topic, report or post with the corresponding ID. The reference will be displayed as a link to the \
  corresponding topic, report or post. Similarly, you can reference a user by typing *`@username`*.\n\n\
  **Moderators** of a topic can delete or edit any post in the topic. When deleting the first post linked to the \
  creation of the report, the report itself is deleted alongside it.

profile_edit = # Edit Profile

report_edit = # Edit Report

topic_edit = # Edit Topic
