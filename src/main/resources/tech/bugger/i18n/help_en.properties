report = # Report

report_create = # Create Report

home = # Homepage

login = # Login

password_forgot = # Forgot Password\n\
  If you have forgotten your password, you can reset your password on this page. To do this, you only need to enter \
  your e-mail address and username registered in the system and we will send you a link shortly after sending it, \
  through which you can set a new password.\n\n\
  In case you got here by accident, you can always use the "Login" button to get back to the login page.

password_set = # Set Password\n\
  On this page you can assign a new password. To do this, you must first type the desired new password in both text \
  fields and press the "Set Password" button.\n\n\
  If both passwords match and you have followed the specified criteria when choosing your password, you will be \
  automatically logged in and redirected to the start page.

profile = # Profile

register = # Register

search = ## Search\n\
  You can type something in the search bar here (not the one in the header) and hit enter or click on the search \
  button to search the site.\n\n\
  You can change which kind of result you want to view by using the buttons below the search bar labeled with the \
  various result types. \
  Beneath those buttons are various filters you can set (save for topic results). When searching for reports, you can \
  specify a latest opening date and an earliest closing date with the format displayed in the input fields. Only \
  reports that were opened before the opening date and not closed before the closing date are displayed. \
  Ticking or unticking the checkboxes below will allow you to further narrow down your search. \
  Finally, you can restrict your search to one particular topic by choosing one from the dropdown menu. Picking none \
  will perform a search across all topics.\n\
  When searching for users, you can filter out both admins and non-admins.\n\n\
  Located below the filter options is a paginated list containing the results. Clicking on one of them will take you \
  to the page containing that result. \
  Clicking on the various column labels of the result list will sort the list. Clicking on the same label again will \
  reverse the order. \
  The controls at the top and bottom of the list will allow you to change between pages and set how many results \
  are displayed per page.
