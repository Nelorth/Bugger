login = ## Login\n\
  Here you can log into your account if you have one – if you don’t, just follow the _Register_ button \
  below the form in order to create an account right away!\n\n\
  By entering valid credentials (username and password) into the corresponding fields and submitting \
  them you will be signed in and redirected to the homepage.\n\n\
  In case you do not remember your password, click on _Forgot password?_ below the form to be \
  lead through a process where you can reset your password. This will include a verification e-mail \
  sent to you, which is why you better keep an eye on your mailbox!

password_forgot = ## Forgot Password\n\
  You forgot your password, huh? Absolutely no problem! By entering your username and e-mail \
  address here, you can request your password to be reset. If the provided information is correct, an \
  e-mail with further instructions and a link will be sent to you. Following the link in the mail will \
  then take you to a page where you can choose a new password.\n\n\
  Note that this link in the e-mail you receive will be valid for only one hour, so please **watch your \
  inbox** and do not wait for too long or else you will have to return here and repeat the process.\n\n\
  In case you got here by accident, you can always use the _Login_ button to get back to the login page.

password_set = ## Set Password\n\
  Please enter your new password and confirm it on this page. If both passwords match and you have followed the \
  required criteria when choosing your password, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the home page.\
  \n\nNote that this functionality is only available for one hour from when we sent you the e-mail by which you came \
  here. Thus, if you wait for too long, you’ll have to repeat the process. It’s really just deciding for a password \
  and there you go!

profile = # Profile

register = ## Registration\n\
  Yay, glad you want to be part of our community! In order to register, provide your\n\
  - desired _unique_* username\n\
  - _valid_ e-mail address\n\
  - first and last name\n\n\
  and shortly after that an e-mail will be sent to the address provided detailing further information \
  on the ultimate step to finalize the registration process – which is setting your account password. \
  The e-mail will contain a link which is valid for one hour only, so be sure to **check your inbox** ;)\n\n\
  *You cannot have the same username as an already existing user, sorry :/

search = ## Search\n\
  You can type something in the search bar here (not the one in the header) and hit enter or click on the search \
  button to search the site.\n\n\
  You can change which kind of result you want to view by using the buttons below the search bar labeled with the \
  various result types. \
  Beneath those buttons are various filters you can set (save for topic results). When searching for reports, you can \
  specify a latest opening date and an earliest closing date with the format displayed in the input fields. Only \
  reports that were opened before the opening date and not closed before the closing date are displayed. \
  Ticking or unticking the checkboxes below will allow you to further narrow down your search. \
  Finally, you can restrict your search to one particular topic by choosing one from the dropdown menu. Picking none \
  will perform a search across all topics.\n\
  When searching for users, you can filter out both admins and non-admins.\n\n\
  Located below the filter options is a paginated list containing the results. Clicking on one of them will take you \
  to the page containing that result. \
  Clicking on the various column labels of the result list will sort the list. Clicking on the same label again will \
  reverse the order. \
  The controls at the top and bottom of the list will allow you to change between pages and set how many results \
  are displayed per page.

statistics = ## Statistics\n\
  Hey, you found the statistics! A bunch of interesting facts about the system are summarized here. \
  What catches the eye at first are three big key figures:\n\
  - **Open Report Count:** The total count of open reports in the selected scope\n\
  - **Average Time Open:** The average time until a report in the selected scope is closed\n\
  - **Average #Posts/Report:** The average number of posts per report in the selected scope\n\n\
  These can be limited to only a certain topic via the drop-down to the right. If no topic is selected as \
  scope, all figures are evaluated system-wide. The figures can also be constrained onto a certain time interval to be \
  considered by providing a latest allowed creation date and an earliest allowed closing date for reports to be \
  taken into account.\n\n\
  The two leaderboards below the figures provide for some competition:\n\
  - **Hottest Reports:** Ranks the top 10 reports _system-wide_ (along with their creators) with regard to the \
  amount of relevance gained within the last 24 hours. Click on the title of a report or its creator’s username to \
  directly get to the corresponding page.\n\
  - **Most Relevant Users:** Ranks the top 10 most relevant users _system-wide_ with regard to the amount of relevance \
  their created reports collectively received. Click on a username to get to that user's profile page.\n\n\
  Have you found your username among the leaderboards yet?

topic = # Topic

admin = ## Administration\n\
  You have several options to configure the system. You can decide whether anonymous users have read access to the \
  system. If you decide to grant read-access only to logged-in users, anonymous users will be redirected to the login \
  page when accessing out of bounds pages. By default, anonymous users have read access. You can allow users to create \
  posts in closed reports. By default, this option is switched off. You can define email formats such as \
  `<user>@fim.uni-passau.de`. Users registering after this change will have to provide an e-mail address matching one \
  of the defined formats.\n\n\
  You can create new users by clicking on the `Create` button at the top of the page. Users created that way do not \
  have to verify their e-mail and will be able to log in immediately.\n\n\
  You can edit a whitelist of data types (e.g. `.png`) users are allowed to upload when creating posts. Limiting the \
  data types enhances security. You can define the boundaries between a user's voting weight by specifying the number \
  of posts a user needs to create to reach the next level.\n\n\
  You can upload the logo of your company and specify its name. They will be displayed prominently in the header. You \
  can specify the imprint and privacy policy of your company in the corresponding input fields, in which \
  [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)  is supported. Links to the respective pages are rendered in the footer. \
  You can choose from a variety of pre-defined color schemes to change the look and feel of your page. You can also \
  upload your own CSS files into the `design/themes` folder. Please note that you are required to save your own CSS \
  files and translation modules separately, since they are not persisted in the database.

post_edit = ## Edit Post\n\
  This page allows you to create or edit a post. You can use [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/) to style the \
  text you enter in the content area. By typing *`!Topic-ID`*, *`#Report-ID`* or *`##Post-ID`* you can reference a \
  specific topic, report or post with the corresponding ID. The reference will be displayed as a link to the \
  corresponding topic, report or post. Similarly, you can reference a user by typing *`@username`*.\n\n\
  **Moderators** of a topic can delete or edit any post in the topic. When deleting the first post linked to the \
  creation of the report, the report itself is deleted alongside it.
