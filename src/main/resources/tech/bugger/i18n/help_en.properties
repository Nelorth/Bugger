  reports and new or edited posts from your subscriptions to open reports, topics, and users. Clicking on an item in \
  the mailbox takes you to the page of the respective report or post.\n\n\
  As an **administrator**, you can create a new topic using the _Create New Topic_ button. This will take you to a \
  separate page.\n\n\

  - *Logo*: Clicking the logo will take you to the homepage from any other page.\n\
  - *Search*: In the search bar one can enter search terms and thus search for reports, users and areas. This is a \
  full-text search, so that posts, among other things, are also searched. However, search suggestions are only offered \

  - *Login*: If you already have an account in our system, you can use this button to log in to the system and thus \
  use the functions that have then been unlocked for you.\n\

  button.\n\

login = ## Login\n\
  Here you can log into your account if you have one – if you don’t, just follow the _Register_ button \
  below the form in order to create an account right away!\n\n\
  By entering valid credentials (username and password) into the corresponding fields and submitting \
  them you will be signed in and redirected to the homepage.\n\n\
  In case you do not remember your password, click on _Forgot password?_ below the form to be \
  lead through a process where you can reset your password. This will include a verification e-mail \
  sent to you, which is why you better keep an eye on your mailbox!

password_forgot = ## Forgot Password\n\
  You forgot your password, huh? Absolutely no problem! By entering your username and e-mail \
  address here, you can request your password to be reset. If the provided information is correct, an \
  e-mail with further instructions and a link will be sent to you. Following the link in the mail will \
  then take you to a page where you can choose a new password.\n\n\
  Note that this link in the e-mail you receive will be valid for only one hour, so please **watch your \
  inbox** and do not wait for too long or else you will have to return here and repeat the process.\n\n\
  In case you got here by accident, you can always use the _Login_ button to get back to the login page.

password_set = ## Set Password\n\
  Please enter your new password and confirm it on this page. If both passwords match and you have followed the \
  required criteria when choosing your password, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the home page.\
  \n\nNote that this functionality is only available for one hour from when we sent you the e-mail by which you came \
  here. Thus, if you wait for too long, you’ll have to repeat the process. It’s really just deciding for a password \
  and there you go!

profile = ## Profile\n\n\
  A user's profile shows their username, their profile picture, the number of posts they created, their voting weight \
  and a list of all topics they moderate. In addition, their personal data (the user's e-mail address, first name, \
  last name, and biography) will be displayed on their profile if the user has chosen to make it visible.\n\n\
  If you're **logged in**, you can subscribe to another user by pressing the _Subscribe_ button on their profile page. \
  Doing so will result in you being notified whenever this user creates or edits a report or post. If you are already \
  subscribed, you can use the _Unsubscribe_ button to cancel your subscription.\n\n\
  In addition to what other users see, your **own profile page** allows you to manage your subscriptions of reports, \
  topics, or users. Clicking the _Edit_ button takes you to the editing page for your profile.\n\n\
  As an **administrator**, you have the same rights about a user's profile as the user has themselves. You can view \
  the user's personal data regardless of their privacy choice and access the profile editing page. \
  You can promote the user to a new administrator or demote another administrator. Both actions require you to \
  re-enter your password. You can overwrite a user's voting weight. You can revoke this to restore the user's previous \
  voting weight.

register = ## Registration\n\
  Yay, glad you want to be part of our community! In order to register, provide your\n\
  - desired _unique_* username\n\
  - _valid_ e-mail address\n\
  - first and last name\n\n\
  and shortly after that an e-mail will be sent to the address provided detailing further information \
  on the ultimate step to finalize the registration process – which is setting your account password. \
  The e-mail will contain a link which is valid for one hour only, so be sure to **check your inbox** ;)\n\n\
  *You cannot have the same username as an already existing user, sorry :/

search = ## Search\n\
  You can type something in the search bar here (not the one in the header) and hit enter or click on the search \
  button to search the site.\n\n\
  You can change which kind of result you want to view by using the buttons below the search bar labeled with the \
  various result types. \
  Beneath those buttons are various filters you can set (save for topic results). When searching for reports, you can \
  specify a latest opening date and an earliest closing date with the format displayed in the input fields. Only \
  reports that were opened before the opening date and not closed before the closing date are displayed. \
  Ticking or unticking the checkboxes below will allow you to further narrow down your search. \
  Finally, you can restrict your search to one particular topic by choosing one from the dropdown menu. Picking none \
  will perform a search across all topics.\n\
  When searching for users, you can filter out both admins and non-admins.\n\n\
  Located below the filter options is a paginated list containing the results. Clicking on one of them will take you \
  to the page containing that result. \
  Clicking on the various column labels of the result list will sort the list. Clicking on the same label again will \
  reverse the order. \
  The controls at the top and bottom of the list will allow you to change between pages and set how many results \
  are displayed per page.

statistics = ## Statistics\n\
  Hey, you found the statistics! A bunch of interesting facts about the system are summarized here. \
  What catches the eye at first are three big key figures:\n\
  - **Open Report Count:** The total count of open reports in the selected scope\n\
  - **Average Time Open:** The average time until a report in the selected scope is closed\n\
  - **Average #Posts/Report:** The average number of posts per report in the selected scope\n\n\
  These can be limited to only a certain topic via the drop-down to the right. If no topic is selected as \
  scope, all figures are evaluated system-wide. The figures can also be constrained onto a certain time interval to be \
  considered by providing a latest allowed creation date and an earliest allowed closing date for reports to be \
  taken into account.\n\n\
  The two leaderboards below the figures provide for some competition:\n\
  - **Hottest Reports:** Ranks the top 10 reports _system-wide_ (along with their creators) with regard to the \
  amount of relevance gained within the last 24 hours. Click on the title of a report or its creator’s username to \
  directly get to the corresponding page.\n\
  - **Most Relevant Users:** Ranks the top 10 most relevant users _system-wide_ with regard to the amount of relevance \
  their created reports collectively received. Click on a report’s title to get to its page.\n\n\
  Have you found your username among the leaderboards yet?

topic = ## Topic\n\
  The overview page of a topic lists reports that belong to this topic, showing information about the reports \
  including ID, title, report type, severity, version, number of duplicates, relevance, the date of the last \
  activity.\n\n\
  You can sort the list of reports by a specific column by clicking on the respective column heading. By default, the \
  reports will be sorted by relevance and severity. You can choose to be shown open, closed, or all reports. By \
  default, you will only be shown open reports. Clicking on a report takes you to its page.\n\n\
  Additionally, the overview page lists the moderators of the topic and the users banned from the topic. \
  You can inspect the profile of a moderator or a banned user by clicking on their username.\n\n\
  To view important statistical figures for the topic and its top reports and users, click _Statistics_.\n\n\
  If you're **logged in**, you can subscribe to the topic using the _Subscribe_ button at the top. If you do so, you \
  will receive notifications about new and edited reports and posts in this particular topic. If you are already \
  subscribed, you can use the _Unsubscribe_ button to cancel your subscription. You can create a new report by \
  clicking the _Create Report_ button.\n\n\
  The moderators of a topic can ban you from the topic. In that case, you will be treated as if you were not logged \
  in. You will not be allowed to create or edit reports and posts.\n\n\
  If you are a **moderator** for the topic, you can add users to the list of moderators. You can also remove \
  users from the moderator list. Appointing a banned user as a new moderator will automatically lift their ban.\n\n\
  You are shown the list of users that are banned from this topic. You may add or remove users by specifying their \
  username. You are automatically subscribed to the topic you moderate.\n\n\
  As an **administrator**, you are shown an _Edit topic_ button that takes you to the editing page of this topic. \
  Furthermore, you can click _Delete Topic_ to delete the topic. Confirm this action by entering your password.

admin = # Administration

post_edit = # Edit Post

profile_edit = ## Edit Profile\n\
  On the editing page of your profile, you can edit your username, password (repetition necessary), e-mail address,\
  first name, last name, and biography. You will be asked to confirm the action by entering your password. When \
  changing your e-mail address, you will be sent a verification link to your new e-mail address which you will have to \
  follow to make the change effective. The link is valid for one hour only.\n\n\
  You may upload an avatar picture as long as it has a resolution of at least 128 by 128 pixels and is no larger than \
  2 MB. Activate the _Delete Avatar_ checkbox to reset your avatar picture to the default picture.\n\n\
  You can control whether non-administrators should be allowed to see your personal data (e-mail \
  address, first name, last name, and biography) by setting your _Profile Visibility_. Administrators will always be \
  able to inspect your personal data. You can select the language that you prefer for the user interface.\n\n\
  You can delete your account by clicking the corresponding button on your profile page. You will be asked to confirm \
  the deletion of your account. Your reports and posts will not be deleted.\n\n\
  If you are an **administrator** and want to edit another user's profile or delete their account, you need to confirm \
  the action by entering your password again. You cannot delete your own account if you are the only administrator.
